### What I learned


```html
<div class="social-item1">
            <p class="weight700 item1">80K</p>
            <p class="weight400 item1" id="gray-text">Followers</p>
</div>
<!-- This code is followed along with the first CSS Snippet -->

```
```css
.weight700.item1 {
    font-weight: 700;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 22px;
    margin-bottom: -5px;
}
/*This snippet includes two classes that I seleted and successfully used to move and style this element. Having never selected an element with two classes before in CSS. I felt so
happy to write this. Although the naming could be better, it still feels nice to actually select a 2 class element and work it good. */
